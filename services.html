<h3>Reservation System</h3>
<p>Book in advance to ensure availability on your preferred date 
and time.
If a driver decides to rent a car beforehand, they go to a car 
rental website or app and find a vehicle that meets their needs. Then, they 
book it and pay for the chosen rental period, if upfront payment is required.
On the appointed day, this customer arrives at the car rental location to pick 
up the chosen car. An agent makes copies of their IDs, explains the terms of 
the lease, instructs them on any special features of the car, and finally 
hands them the keys. When the customer drops off the car, the agent checks its 
mileage and inspects for any damages.
In fact, the car rental process involves many more operations under the hood. 
Automating them improves the speed and quality of service. Let’s zoom in on 
how each module of the Car RRS contributes to that.

alt="Flexible Rental Periods">
<h3>Flexible Rental Periods</h3>
<p>Rent by the hour, day, week, or even on a monthly basis to suit 
your needs.<br>
Maintaining flexible plans for bookings, such as one-way 
trips, local and long-distance packages helps the customers choose one 
according to their convenience. Providing redundant extras is an exercise in 
futility, one for which the customer will not be ready to pay.<br>
<br>
Another option is to customize fare plans for the holiday 
season and offer various discounts and coupons that the customers can cash-in 
later. Though this is more useful for long-distance travellers, fares can be 
reduced for premium members around the holidays too.

alt="24/7 Customer Support">
<h3>24/7 Customer Support</h3>
<p>Our dedicated team is available around the clock to assist you 
with any inquiries or issues.<br>
Unlike increasing throughput on a production line (making 10% 
more product is usually fairly simple), the move to 24/7 support is not so 
linear: one day your coverage may be 8, 12, or perhaps 16 hours, the next it’s 
24 (depending on the number of inquiries). By doing “more of the same,” the 
cost of the support function in your business will go up by 60%-100%.
So why bother?
There are three good reasons:
To provide support in local time zones
Most obviously, you may want to provide support in local time zones.
Your growth market may already have an on-the-ground team; in which case 
you’re lucky.
Most businesses, however, must seed new markets by providing great support and 
building a reputation without the paying customer base in place.
And it matters: a European Commission report found that 42% of consumers said 
they never purchase products and services with sales and support in other 
languages.
